# Latency of various methods

This runs the same test than imbalance-all but is dedicated to measuring latency, according to the input load. We change the input load by accelerating the trace, from memory a little.


make test will run the test, using NPF and the ../dpdk.testie

make graph will do the graph using plot.py
