# Imbalance study
This experiment shows the imbalance between the various methods.

The "imbalance" experiments show the imbalance with a fixed number of core (8), using boxplots, while the "imbalance-all" experiments show the imbalance for a range of number of cores, using therefore a median line and 25+25perc background.
